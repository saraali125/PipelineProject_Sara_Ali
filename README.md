PipelineProject_Sara_Ali
For the first problem, both SRA files were dowloaded using wget. This was found from the links that were provided in the homework. The links I chose in the SRA Normalized row. 
I used the codes: wget https://sra-pub-run-odp.s3.amazonaws.com/sra/SRR5660030/SRR5660030, and wget https://sra-pub-run-odp.s3.amazonaws.com/sra/SRR5660033/SRR5660033

I made a python script that produced a text tile with output named pipelineproject.log in a directory named PipelineProject_Sara_Ali. This was done  in terminal using the commands: mkdir -p PipelineProject_Sara_Ali, then cd PipelineProject_Sara_Ali, touch PipelineProject.log
